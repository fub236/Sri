Docker Container Commands:

1) Create a container (without starting it):
#docker create [IMAGE]

2) Rename an existing container:
#docker rename [CONTAINER_NAME] [NEW_CONTAINER_NAME]

3) Run a command in a new container:
#docker run [IMAGE] [COMMAND]

docker run --rm [IMAGE] – removes a container after it exits.
docker run -td [IMAGE] – starts a container and keeps it running.
docker run -it [IMAGE] – starts a container, allocates a pseudo-TTY connected to the container’s stdin, and creates an interactive bash shell in the container.
docker run -it-rm [IMAGE] – creates, starts, and runs a command inside the container. Once it executes the command, the container is removed.

4)Delete a container (if it is not running):
docker rm [CONTAINER]

5) Update the configuration of one or more containers:
docker update [CONTAINER]

6) Start a container:
docker start [CONTAINER]

7) Stop a running container:
docker stop [CONTAINER]

8) Stop a running container and start it up again:
docker restart [CONTAINER]

9) Pause processes in a running container:
docker pause [CONTAINER]

10)Unpause processes in a running container:
docker unpause [CONTAINER]

11) Kill a container by sending a SIGKILL to a running container:
docker kill [CONTAINER]

12) Attach local standard input, output, and error streams to a running container:
docker attach [CONTAINER]

Docker Image Commands:

1) Create an image from a Dockerfile:
docker build [URL]
docker build -t – builds an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory and tags the image

2) Pull an image from a registry:
docker pull [IMAGE]

3) Push an image to a registry:
docker push [IMAGE]

4) Create an image from a tarball:
docker import [URL/FILE]

5) Create an image from a container:
docker commit [CONTAINER] [NEW_IMAGE_NAME]

6) Remove an image:
docker rmi [IMAGE]

7) Load an image from a tar archive or stdin:
docker load [TAR_FILE/STDIN_FILE]

8) Save an image to a tar archive, streamed to STDOUT with all parent layers, tags, and versions:
docker save [IMAGE] > [TAR_FILE]

Docker Commands for Container and Image Information:

1) List running containers:
docker ps
docker ps -a – lists both running containers and ones that have stopped

2) List the logs from a running container:
docker logs [CONTAINER]

3) List low-level information on Docker objects:
docker inspect [OBJECT_NAME/ID]

4) List real-time events from a container:
docker events [CONTAINER]

5) Show port (or specific) mapping for a container:
docker port [CONTAINER]

6) Show running processes in a container:
docker top [CONTAINER]

7) Show live resource usage statistics of containers:
docker stats [CONTAINER]

8) Show changes to files (or directories) on a filesystem:
docker diff [CONTAINER]

9) List all images that are locally stored with the docker engine:
docke image ls

10) Show the history of an image:
docker history [IMAGE]

Networking Commands:

1) List networks:
docker network ls

2) Remove one or more networks:
docker network rm [NETWORK]

3) Show information on one or more networks:
docker network inspect [NETWORK]

4) Connects a container to a network:
docker network connect [NETWORK] [CONTAINER]

5) Disconnect a container from a network:
docker network disconnect [NETWORK] [CONTAINER]
